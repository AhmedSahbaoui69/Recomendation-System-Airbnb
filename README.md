# Airbnb Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a recommendation microservice for Airbnb listings that combines two approaches:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes listing descriptions, rating, and other features to recommend similar properties.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies patterns in user booking history to suggest listings liked by similar users.

This hybrid approach provides more relevant and diverse recommendations than either method alone.
